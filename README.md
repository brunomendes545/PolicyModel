# Policy Model

This is a draft version for an easy and fast implementation package for a simple IS-MP-PC model to understand monetary policy, shocks and frictions.
A Phillips Curve describing how inflation depends on output.
An IS Curve describing how output depends upon interest rates.
A Monetary Policy Rule describing how the central bank sets interest rates depending on in and/or output.

This package is based on the work on Karl Whelan Lecture Notes on Macroeconomics (2020) and Nuno Alves Macroeconomic Policy course (2023).
